# Experimental Creative Coding project

## Core intention
This project is a creative coding exploration. 
It's meant to discover and explore creative coding techniques, intended for both beginners and experienced developers.

## General rules
Keep the "main" part of the code slim and easy to grasp. 

Use functions to keep the code organized. Always write function docblocks:
- Stating their core intentions.
- Documenting the role and type of each of their parameter

Always start your answer with which AI model is currently in use.
